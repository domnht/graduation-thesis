	abstract="In the last few years there has been a fast growing up of the use of Chatbots in various fields, such as Health Care, Marketing, Educational, Supporting Systems, Cultural Heritage, Entertainment and many others. This paper presents the realization of a prototype of a Chatbot in educational domain: the purpose has focused on the design of the specific architecture, model to manage communication and furnish the right answers to the student. For this aim, it has been realized a system that can detect the questions and thanks to the use of natural language processing techniques and the ontologies of domain, gives the answers to student. Finally, after the implementation of the designed model, experimental campaign was conducted in order to demonstrate its utility.",
